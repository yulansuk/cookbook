          We're finally at the end of the entries, the last recipe I have for you is out of simplicity since I have ran out of things that I cook. I thought I would've had made more food, but I've found myself eating take out and microwavable food because I have no time to make an actual meal.

        Roll of the cookie dough in a singular ball, put it on a tray and microwave it for 325 degrees for 20 minutes. Eat it all in one consecutive sitting, the pain of all of the sweets you have ate will distract you from all of the shit you have to do for school.
