<h1>ARMY STEW</h1>
</div>

<div>
<h2> My Childhood Meal</h2>
<p>My father made his own version of Army Stew using a ramen  packet.<br>
     He promised me he would show me how to make it  but he never did. <br> So I'm just guesstimating here. My father was always the better cook <br> in the family  I think I got my cooking skills from my mom.</p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Here is What You'll Need!</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Shin Ramen (The whole thing)</li>
    <li>Gochujang</li>
    <li>Bouillion Powder</li>
    <li>Pork Belly (any meat will do)</li>
    <li>Kimchi and Kimchi Juice</li>
    <li>Green Peppers</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
    <li>Scallions</li>
</ul>
<strong>Again, I eyeballed the porportions, so your hand will <br> naturally tell you when there's enough of each thing.</strong>
