    <h1> RED BULL ICEE </h1>
    <p> This has been my life line when it comes to my college experience. During one of my late plunges into doing my assignments, I craved something cold and sweet. Due to my cravins, I created a monstrosity which housed all my fears in my graphic design talents and skills. I call it, the Red Bull Icee.</p>
