<h2> Stole my roll on Mudae, hog ass. Don't you have enough characters.</h2>
</div>


<div class="paragraph">
<p> Okay like I don't even play ZZZ anymore, but I know for sure that I played more then you, you hog. Like in the server that we were in, you have like millions of characters on Mudae already and I have like two. Like how much more do you need I swear to god, like I would claim characters for you because I was nice and pleasent enough to do so. Even after you had a big baby freak out on us, telling us you didn't want to be our friend anymore. Okay? I don't want to be your friend either, the fuck. You can be friends with Daiko's fuck ass, actually. Like I know no one hanging out with them in real life because of how miserable they are, so go on, hang out with Daiko's dumb ass.</p>
<p> Also, how are you friends with Buggy. You're literally lesbian and he said that he would ban all of the LGBTQ identities off of the server just because he thought KV was getting bullied. He would rather protect a straight man who don't even frankly fuck with him, rather then you. Like, okay, you'd rather be friends with the homophobic Texan then us, like talk about not having a back bone, like actually. I hope that you're reflecting on your actions, but i know that you're not cause you're a hog like that. Look, is it immature of me to leave the server over Mudae? Yes, but I don't care! I'll leave a server over anything if the people there are annoying enough, aka, YOU GUYS, FUCK.  </p>
